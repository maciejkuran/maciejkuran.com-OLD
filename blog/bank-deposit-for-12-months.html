            In this exercise, I am going through higher-order functions and callbacks JS concept. A function that
            receives another function as an argument is called the higher-order function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine, that you have some savings and you just saw an advertisement for the bank. The Yellow Bank offers
            1.5% / month. The annual deposit cost is 3 %. However, there are 2 restrictions such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>- The amount has to be &gt;= 5000 $.</li>
            <li>
              - You cannot break the deposit before 12 months. If you do, the penalty will be 20 % and in addition, the
              earned income will be canceled.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Also, a citizen is required to pay individual income tax to the government.</p>
          <p>
            In this example a higher-order function is <i>'newBankOffer(amount, fn1, fn2, fn3, fn4, fn5)'</i> where I
            set 6 parameters. This function operates at a high level of abstraction, leaving low-level details to
            low-level functions – callbacks.
          </p>
          <p>The results of this program are logged to the console.</p>

                console.log(`${amount}$ qualifies for our savings program. Your annual income will be ${fn1(amount)}$. We charge an annual fee for the deposit of ${fn2(amount)}$.

In the case of income: ${fn3(amount)}$, the tax will be: ${fn4(amount)}$. \n\nThe contract is signed for 12 months, which means you cannot break the deposit before 12 months. If you break it, the penalty will be 20% out of ${amount}$: ${fn5(amount)}$, and in addition the earned income will be canceled. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, contact office@yellowbank.com `);
