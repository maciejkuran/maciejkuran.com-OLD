                The goal of this project was to design and build an application. I chose to develop a Unit Converter
                from scratch. I wanted to challenge myself and try to build a scalable application, a size, and
                complexity which would be difficult for any novice programmer.

            <p>
              UnitConverted.com is a free unit converter where you can easily convert all common types of units: length,
              temperature, area, volume, weight, time, and speed. It is a super helpful tool if you expect to have some
              units converted fast. In addition, you can read the definitions of each unit with direct reference to
              scientific sources.

              I was excited to develop my first web application after just 1 month of learning JavaScript - actually my
              first programming language. The entire application development process went successfully as intended.
              However, this was a constant work, around 8 hours/day, 6 days/week.

            <h3>Problems I encountered during the development process</h3>
            <p>
              Honestly, I didn't encounter many problems while coding. To a surprise, with a little bit of analyzing I
              was actually able to match javascript concepts very fast to solve any problems. However, I got stuck for a
              while styling website ...
            </p>
            <p><span>SCSS and nested classes</span></p>
            <p>
              What I love about SCSS are nested classes. I just find it comfortable to create some sort of "class
              trees". I say it's comfortable because anytime I am back to a specific class to add some extra styling,
              someway I can easily locate this class, without using the built VS Code 'search' tool. Certainly, there
              are other advantages of nesting classes such as clean code and not having to repeat code. For example, if
              div with a class of 'flex' is inside a div with a class of 'wrapper', and there's a &lt;p&gt; tag inside
              that div 'flex', you may write it that way.
            </p>
            <pre>
            .wrapper {

            .flex {
            
            p { }
            
            }
            
            }
            
            //instead of
            
            .wrapper {}
            
            .flex p {}
            
            .flex {}
            </pre>
            <p>
              However, nested classes can be tricky especially when you want to override some styles. That's what I
              experienced.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tried to override some styles, especially doing media queries, and even though I added styles to a
              certain HTML element with a class of 'x', the styles were not overridden.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, it's all because I ignored initially declared nested classes. What I mean, based on the random
              example given above is if you declared initially div with a class of 'flex' to be nested inside the
              'wrapper', the compiled result of this nesting in the style.css sheet will be:
            </p>
            <pre>
            .wrapper .flex {}

            .wrapper .flex p {}
              </pre
            >
            <p>
              So in fact if you want to override any styles doing for example media queries, you should use previously
              declared nested classes.

            <h3>Overall feelings</h3>
            <p>
              I am happy that I was able to write my first application. It is not something innovative, but it is mine,
              from A to Z designed and coded by me. I am aware that it could be coded way better so I hope to come back
              to this project one day and refactor this long code.
