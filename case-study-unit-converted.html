          <p>
            The goal of this project was to design and build an application. I chose to develop a Unit Converter from
            scratch. I wanted to challenge myself and try to build a scalable application, a size, and complexity which
            would be difficult for any novice programmer.

            I did my best and worked diligently to accomplish this project. I am aware that this app could have been
            done better. However, my goal in developing this app was to challenge myself, as a beginner, to design a
            modern interface and to develop it from scratch. I am happy with the final result and would appreciate it if
            you would read my case study. All suggestions are welcome.

            <h3>Let's start from the beginning - what is UnitConverted.com ?</h3>
            <p>
              UnitConverted.com is a free unit converter where you can easily convert all common types of units: length,
              temperature, area, volume, weight, time, and speed. It is a super helpful tool if you expect to have some
              units converted fast. In addition, you can read the definitions of each unit with direct reference to
              scientific sources.

            <h3>Files management</h3>
            <p>
              It's all great as long as you deal with a few files you might probably skip this part. This time I needed
              to prepare myself for over 50 files.
            </p>
            <p>
              Files management was necessary to organize the development part. This app is scalable which means that
              anytime it can be further developed - new categories, units and functionality added.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is great if you open your app folder and can figure out fast what is what and get to work without
              wasting time. It was a part of my plan.

            <h3>SCSS - CSS - files management</h3>
            <p>
              You might ask me why did I choose to write styles in SCSS. Well, I find it way more comfortable to divide
              styles into seperate files. I mean to divide it logically and smart. This helps to organize code and just
              work faster. I love SASS and I think it's a powerful tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also believe that SASS helps me to follow the Don't repeat yourself principle. I guess, I've done a
              pretty good job in this project, not repeating styles by creating plenty of style cascades.
            </p>
            <p>
              As browsers do not read SCSS files, all SCSS code was compiled to CSS with the help of VS Code extension
              called 'Live Sass Compiler' by Glenn Marks. When the first line of scss code is written, and 'Watch Sass'
              is clicked, the extension automatically creates style.css file and all SCSS code is compiled to clean CSS.
              I have made some general changes in the VS Code file called settings.json, where I requested also to
              create .min.css (minified version). I also requested to create a new path where all of my .css files will
              be initially created. (./public/css).

            <p>
              style.scss file has 3 lines of code where I import _globalStyles.scss, _desktopDefault.scss,
              _breakpoints.scss, with the help of @use syntax. I used @use instead of @import since I've read that
              @import syntax might not be supported anymore, being replaced by @use.
            </p>
            <pre>
            @use './globalStyles';
            @use './desktopDefault';

            >
            <p>
              _globalStyle.scss is the file that contains general repeatable styles used throughout the entire project.
              What do I mean by repeatable styles ?
            </p>
            <p>
              I set style properties for headers (h1-h4), p tag, a tag, ul, assign default colors to :root, set
              properties such as box-sizing to border-box, padding, margin to 0. I created styles that I assigned to
              html and body. Basically, this file includes very general styles. If any of these styles will need to be
              changed later, I can easily just override any of them in the .desktopDefault file or .breakpoints file.
            </p>
            <pre>
            * {
                box-sizing: border-box;
                padding: 0;
                margin: 0;
              }
              
              :root {
                --clr-lightBlue: #40bac2;
                --clr-darkBlue: #056b78;
                --clr-blueBackground: #0c052d;
                --clr-greyBackground: #242424;
              }
              
              html {
                font-size: 62.5%;
                font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
                color: white;
                background: linear-gradient(#202020, #0c052d);
                line-height: 35px;
              }
              
              etc.

            <p>_desktopDefault.scss are basically the project styles.</p>
            <p>_breakpoints.scss file contains actually breakpoints. I initially set 5 breakpoints.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="sectionDivier">
            <h3>SCSS - breakpoints</h3>
            <p>I initially set 5 breakpoints.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>max-width: 1199.98px</li>
              <li>max-width: 991.98px</li>
              <li>max-width: 767.98px</li>
              <li>max-width: 575.98px</li>
              <li>max-width: 320px</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              However, the first breakpoint (1199.98px) was unnecessary so I removed it and started responsive styling
              from the breakpoint of max-width: 991.98px. Most of the changes were done in the breakpoint of max-width:
              575.98px.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also created some extra tags in the HTML, to make this app 100% mobile-friendly. These tags got hidden
              for desktop/laptop/tablet versions and are visible only in a mobile version.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example &lt;p&gt; tag with the class of 'from' was replaced by a &lt;p&gt; tag with the class of
              'fromMobile'. You may ask me why did I do it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, the problem was that &lt;p&gt; tag with the class of 'from' was in a &lt;div&gt; that has a 'flex'
              property set. This made it impossible to style on mobile to the point, where I wanted to let it be. That's
              why I created a new &lt;p&gt; tag and I grabbed it out of that &lt;div&gt; and moved it to the top. I hope
              you understand what I mean.

            <h3>JavaScript project files</h3>
            <p>
              I decided to create 3 .js files: main.js, functions.js, and components.js. The proper division of files
              allowed me to keep the project in order and in case of any changes I would be able to do it intuitively
              and quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main.js file contains querySelectors that allow accessing DOM elements, event listener (convert
              button), for loops (looping both select option windows), with multi if statements that call a particular
              function if a given condition is met by a user.
            </p>
            <p>
              The functions.js file is individual functions written for each unit conversion that returns the value of
              the expression. All of these functions are exported and imported into the main.js file.
            </p>
            <p>
              The components.js file is the file that contains some individual components of the application that are
              duplicated and appear in multiple places on the interface. I created components like footer, unit lists,
              search-wrapper, with the idea that in the future if I want to apply changes, I don't have to edit in
              dozens of places in the application but I can edit it from one place, and the changes will automatically
              appear everywhere. Components are sort of like re-usable templates.

                <p>
                  The category search filter is the app component that is imported in the HTML sheet &lt;search-wrapper
                  class="searchWrapper"&gt; &lt;/search-wrapper&gt;.
                </p>
                <p>This problem was solved easily.</p>
                <p>
                  I actually accessed DOM element &lt;select&gt; with the given class of 'categories' adding this
                  element to the variable named 'categories'.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I accessed DOM element &lt;button&gt; with the class of 'find' and added an Event Listener on 'click',
                  with a callback function, passing no parameters.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I created a mutable variable 'let' and named it 'options'. I assigned to the variable 'options', the
                  variable 'categories', adding property 'selectedOptions'.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I ran a for loop that looped through the 'options', giving me access to selected option by a user.
                  Once a user chooses a specific category and clicks on the 'find' button, a category page will open.
                </p>

            <p><span>2. Functions that convert the user input value</span></p>
            <p>
              I wrote an arrow function and passed the parameter 'inputValue'. The 'InputValue' is basically whatever a
              user will write in the input field.
            </p>
            <pre>
            // Decimal numbers are NOT rounded

            //---------------------------------------
            //LENGTH CONVERTER FUNCTIONS
            
            export const mmToCm = (inputValue) =&gt; {
              return inputValue / 10;
            };
            
            </pre>
            <p>
              As the 'inputValue' parameter is a DOM element, I accessed this element with a basic line of code. I made
              sure, that any number written in the input field will be converted to a "Number", instead of being a
              'String'. By default, any content in the input field is treated as a "String".
            </p>
            <pre>
            const input = Number(document.querySelector('.inputUnit').value);

            <p>
              A certain function gets invoked, when condition is met, which basically means that in &lt;select&gt;
              &lt;option&gt; user picked to convert mm to cm. The name 'calc' is added initially to each function
              because I imported to main.js all of the functions from the functions.js file and named that import as
              'calc'.
            </p>
            <p>So the function is invoked that way.</p>
            <pre>calc.mmToCm(input);</pre>

            </p>
            <p>
              Select options are basically the units. There are 2 &lt;select&gt; tags with &lt;options&gt; in the HTML
              sheet. User can decide what units should be converted.

          </pre
            >
            <p>To access by class &lt;select&gt; in DOM, I simply wrote the code.</p>
            <pre>
            let unitsFrom = document.querySelector('.unitsFrom');
            let unitsTo = document.querySelector('.unitsTo');
            </pre>
            <p>
              To access options (&lt;option&gt; tag) inside the &lt;select&gt;, I created the variables 'options1' &
              'options2' and assigned to them created before variables such as unitsFrom & unitsTo, with a property
              'selectedOptions'.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then I created a for loop inside another for loop and looped through the 'options1' and 'options2' gaining
              access to each individual &lt;option&gt;.
            </p>
            <pre>
            (...) //The rest of the code
            let options1 = unitsFrom.selectedOptions;
            let options2 = unitsTo.selectedOptions;
            
              for (let a = 0; a &lt; options1.length; a++) {
                console.log(options1[0]);
                for (let b = 0; b &lt; options2.length; b++) {
                  console.log(options2[0]);
              (...)
            </pre>
            <p>
              How does the browser know what units a user choose ? I created if conditions (inside 2 for loops) where I
              pointed the first looped element among the 'options1' & 'options2', which is the 'options1[0]' &
              'options2[0]'. Just a reminder that robots count from 0 instead of 1.
            </p>
            <p>Logically, the chosen unit by a user will always be the first one - [0].</p>
            <p>Based on if statements the browser knows what to do and what functions should be invoked.</p>
            <pre>
            if (options1[0] === frommm && options2[0] === tocm) {
              output =
                `${input} ` + `${options1[0].textContent}` + ' = ' + calc.mmToCm(input) + ` ${options2[0].textContent}`;
              document.querySelector('.conversionResult').textContent = output;
              document.querySelector('.formula').textContent = `Formula: ${input} ${options1[0].textContent} divided by 10 `;
            }
      </pre
            >
            <p>
              <span
                >4. Access DOM elements to display dynamically the calculation result and formula on the screen</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              There are 2 empty &lt;p&gt; tags created in the HTML sheet with the class of 'conversionResult' and the
              'formula'.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/img/Conversion result UnitConverted.jpg"
              alt="Unit conversion result unitconverted.com app"
              class="imgArticle"
            />
            <pre>
            &lt;p class="conversionResult"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class="formula"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            </pre>
            <p>
              I created the empty variable 'output'. The result of conversion is based on the if condition and its
              function is assigned to the variable 'output'. A mutable value that the 'output' variable contains, gets
              assigned to DOM element with the class of 'conversionResult' with added property of 'textContent'. The
              result of conversion will be dynamically displayed in the &lt;p&gt; tag.
            </p>
            <p>
              'Formula' was done the same way, excluding assigning output. I accessed DOM element with the class of
              'formula' and assigned a string with dynamic fields such as 'input' and 'options1'.
            </p>
            <pre>
            if (options1[0] === frommm && options2[0] === tocm) {
              output =
                `${input} ` + `${options1[0].textContent}` + ' = ' + calc.mmToCm(input) + ` ${options2[0].textContent}`;
              document.querySelector('.conversionResult').textContent = output;
              document.querySelector('.formula').textContent = `Formula: ${input} ${options1[0].textContent} divided by 10 `;

            <h3>Problems I encountered during the development process</h3>
            <p>
              Honestly, I didn't encounter many problems while coding. To a surprise, with a little bit of analyzing I
              was actually able to match javascript concepts very fast to solve any problems. However, I got stuck for a
              while styling website ...
            </p>
            <p><span>SCSS and nested classes</span></p>
            <p>
              What I love about SCSS are nested classes. I just find it comfortable to create some sort of "class
              trees". I say it's comfortable because anytime I am back to a specific class to add some extra styling,
              someway I can easily locate this class, without using the built VS Code 'search' tool. Certainly, there
              are other advantages of nesting classes such as clean code and not having to repeat code. For example, if
              div with a class of 'flex' is inside a div with a class of 'wrapper', and there's a &lt;p&gt; tag inside
              that div 'flex', you may write it that way.
            </p>
            <pre>
            .wrapper {

            .flex {
            
            p { }
            
            }
            
            }
            
            //instead of
            
            .wrapper {}
            
            .flex p {}
            
            .flex {}
            </pre>
            <p>
              However, nested classes can be tricky especially when you want to override some styles. That's what I
              experienced.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tried to override some styles, especially doing media queries, and even though I added styles to a
              certain HTML element with a class of 'x', the results were not displayed in the browser. I was confused
              about why the styles are not overridden.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, it's all because I ignored initially declared nested classes. What I mean, based on the random
              example given above is if you declared initially div with a class of 'flex' to be nested inside the
              'wrapper', the compiled result of this nesting in the style.css sheet will be:
            </p>
            <pre>
            .wrapper .flex {}

            .wrapper .flex p {}
              </pre
            >
            <p>
              So in fact if you want to override any styles doing for example media queries, you should use previously
              declared nested classes.
