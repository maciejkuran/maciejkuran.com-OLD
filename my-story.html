            </p>
            <p>Hi, I am Maciej Kuran-Janowski, a self-taught programmer and designer from Poland.</p>
            <p>
              I was born on 1993-10-27 in Warsaw, Poland. I graduated from music school, hospitality technical college,
              and then Nicolai Copernicus University with a bachelor's degree in homeland security. I am happily
              married, owning 2 amazing pugs. You may ask, why programming and such a life change? After six years of
              being an entrepreneur, I craved change.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2021 I needed to re-organize my life, to figure out what's next and what I want my professional life to
              look like for the next decades. I felt like there was a big gap in my current professional life and I
              needed an activity that would fulfill me and unleash my creativity.

            <h2>Innumerable ideas</h2>
            <p>
              I thought of innumerable ideas but none of them made sense to me except programming and web
              design/development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started from scratch. Reading tons of articles and going through tutorials, helped me begin my WordPress
              adventure in 2021. I learned so much in the first year of developing business websites & e-commerce stores
              for many clients.

            <h3>The beginnings - WordPress adventure using builders and plugins</h3>
            <p>
              I started my WordPress adventure with Elementor builder. I think this tool is amazing for those who need a
              basic, modern, stylish website. You may build the website super fast without any coding skills. Then with
              Elementor I started using Crocoblock plugins, which allowed me to build dynamic websites. I went through
              several commissions and decided to run my own little Agency called FIKKU.pl.

            <h3>My conclusion after a year of adventure with WordPress</h3>
            <p>
              Using different plugins wasn't enough though. I felt totally limited. It was then I knew that coding
              knowledge would be necessary to achieve my web development goals. This is where everything started.

                  I know, I didn't surprise you but I guess that's the way how everyone else started. I found a highly
                  rated course that was led by Daniel Walter Scott who owns "Bring Your Own Laptop" course platform. He
                  is an Adobe Certified Instructor. I picked him because the course structure looked just simply great
                  for a beginner. Not too much, not too little. Also, his attitude and teaching skills are awesome. This
                  was a great choice - no regrets.

                  If someone thinks that one course should set you in the position of becoming a "pro". It doesn't work
                  like that. I expected that this course will help me to understand coding basics in HTML and CSS, but a
                  real challenge starts afterward. By going up through this course I realized, how much is to learn but
                  it didn't make me feel overwhelmed even for a second. I wanted to push coding further.

            <h3>My first serious coding commission</h3>
            <p>
              It was for my dad. I wasn't asked to do it, but I offered my dad to design and develop his basic business
              website. The site was supposed to be clean and mobile-friendly. I was excited.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of this project was basically to accomplish it. I know that it sounds weird but at that time I
              didn't feel confident in basic stuff, such as flexbox, media queries and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today I realize how many code repetitions I have done, and how many headaches I have caused myself by
              using strange practices. Well, I didn't expect to follow the Don't repeat yourself principle as the goal
              was to develop it to the point where everything works.
            </p>
            <p>PS. Actually, at that time I had no idea about the DRY principle existence.</p>
            <p>
              I completed the project and deployed the files on a server.

              <div>
                <p>
                  One day I was reading about how powerful SASS is. I had mixed feelings because I didn't feel like
                  learning something new unless I am 100 % confident in CSS. However, I gave it a try as I realized that
                  SCSS is an "extended version of CSS". I can't complain now as working with scss sheets organizes my
                  style sheets and increases workflow.

              Learning Bootstrap

            </h3>
            <div class="sectionFlex">
              <div>
                <p>
                  Well, honestly I wasn't excited going up through the process of learning the basics of this framework.
                  Copying and pasting the code, and styling with pre-made classes sort of brought me a DEJA VU feeling
                  from WordPress times where I used to develop websites with builders and plugins. This wasn't fun! ( I
                  mean it was but just at the beginning).
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, I completely understand the concept of using Bootstrap. If you want to have the visual
                  aspects of the website done fast, or maybe you work under time pressure, or maybe the project
                  agreements made with the Client including using Bootstrap as the HTML, CSS, and JS library - then this
                  is a great choice.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  However, so far my design concepts were far from default Bootstrap ones, so I might have to almost
                  redesign everything. That's pointless. Also copying and pasting is not my current programming target
                  so I said "see you later" to Bootstrap :)
                </p>
                <p>Anyway, I know what Bootstrap is about and can use it anytime where it's necessary.</p>

            <h3>Vanilla Javascript - the beginnings</h3>
            <p>Starting to learn javascript was a tough time. After all, javascript is a real programming language.</p>
            <p>
              The first course that I decided to pick was "The Creative Javascript Course" for beginners by
              DevelopedByEd.<br />
              Dev Ed is a recognizable, funny YouTuber. His attitude and personality encouraged me to go with him as my
              first course.
            </p>
            <p>However, it didn't work out as I decided to pause this course somewhere in the middle.</p>
            <p>
              I will emphasize that this is not Ed's fault as he can undoubtedly teach and is a great js programmer. In
              my opinion, the course was not for me because it was geared towards building web applications alone. There
              was a lack of complex discussion of js concepts, and connecting concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I felt I was doing wrong from the beginning was taking tons of notes and learning multiple lines of
              code by heart. It is not how it should be!
            </p>
            <p>
              A programmer's job is creativity. Creating solutions to existing problems. I realized that you don't have
              to copy someone else's code to achieve the same goal. You can write it your way. You need to know the
              concepts and let them match a problem.

              just great. The amount of time and effort that Jonas put into course development and several concepts

              particular, I still remember this feeling once I solved a specific problem successfully on my own.

                  Programming is about connecting concepts. I understood by solving problems by myself, sometimes with a
                  bit of research which is fine. Getting stuck for hours was a part of the plan.

                  I realized that every program, no matter how big or small, is built up of connected concepts. It
                  sounds a bit trivial but well, it took me some time to realize it. Nothing comes easy.

              The goal of this project was to design and build an application. I chose to develop a Unit Converter from

            <h3>The reason why I am a good programming student and will always be</h3>
            <p>
              I have always been different, meaning I saw the world from a different perspective. I I love to understand
              the matter of many things and phenomena that surround us.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ability to program and programming itself sets no boundaries for us. That is, we can create beautiful
              and valuable products. We can simply change the world with lines of code. Code, knowledge of syntax, is
              just a tool for achieving beautiful things.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that if you do what you feel, you devote yourself to it completely. You don't count the hours,
              the days, you don't feel as tired. You just do it.

              I am patient because I know that programming has a beginning but no endpoint. I mean, we can mark the end
              of learning, but it will be an illusionary point because by becoming one, a learning process will continue
              throughout my career.

              On the other hand, isn't it natural? I am interested in many languages or frameworks that I would love to
